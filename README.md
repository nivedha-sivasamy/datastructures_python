## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for any programmer or computer science enthusiast. This repository provides Python implementations of common data structures such as stacks, queues, doubly-linked lists, and graphs. It also includes implementations of fundamental algorithms like binary and linear search, bubble sort, selection sort, and a shortest path algorithm for graphs.

## Data Structures

### Stack

The stack data structure implemented in this repository follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It provides methods for pushing, popping, and peeking elements.

### Queue

The queue data structure follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It includes methods for enqueueing and dequeuing elements.

### Deque (Double-ended Queue)

A deque is a versatile data structure that allows inserting and removing elements from both ends efficiently.

### Linked List

The linked list implementation provides a basic singly-linked list structure with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Graph

The graph implementation includes basic functionality for creating and traversing graphs, as well as finding the shortest path between nodes using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.

## Algorithms

### Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value in a sorted list or array.

### Linear Search

Linear search is a simple algorithm for finding a target value by iterating through the elements one by one.

### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Selection Sort

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the list and moves it to the beginning.

### Shortest Path in a Graph (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

This repository includes an algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm, which is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code for each data structure and algorithm in their respective directories. You can use these implementations as reference or integrate them into your Python projects as needed.
